!!! wip "Under Construction"
    <strong>Docs are a work in progress,</strong> but you'll still find lots of working examples and hands-on tutorials.  This is a sibling project for [compose.mk]({{jinja.vars.composemk_docs_url}}), which is a more general automation framework; The k8s-tools suite serves as a reference implementation for extending it.

Meet the **k8s-tools suite**, which aggregates 30+ individual utilities for working with kubernetes into a [single dockerized toolchain]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/toolbox), and provides an [automation framework]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/k8s.mk) for extending and interacting it. Project-local clusters, cluster lifecycle automation, customizable TUIs, and more, with no dependencies at all beyond what's already in your dev environment.

{{macros.img_link("e2e-k3d.commander.gif", mkdocs, "95%")}}

The k8s-tools suite operates at a project-automation layer that is designed to embrace and extend other tools, so it doesn't really conflict or compete with anything.  It's especially useful for CI/CD pipelines or prototyping systems, and is designed to be [embedded alongside existing projects]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/integration).

Tool-container definitions use docker-compose, and the automation framework is Makefile-based. 

### What does it do?
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

Individual utilities [in the toolbox]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/toolbox) work as usual on any sort of kubernetes platform, regardless of where or how it's hosted.  But there's also a major emphasis on the kind of [project-local clusters](#) that you might be interested in for local-first development, platform-agnostic end-to-end tests, etc.  To that end, the toolbox incorporates dockerized versions of `k3d`, `kind`, and `minikube`, and [scripting that makes use of those containers]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/k8s.mk) is easy.

!!! goals "Use Cases:"
    1. Cluster lifecycle / development / debugging workflows in general.
    1. Project-local kubernetes clusters & corresponding lifecycle automation.
    1. Decoupling project automation from the choice of CI/CD backend.
    1. Separation of automation tasks from runtime / container context specs.
    1. Per-project tool-versioning, providing defaults but allowing overrides
    1. Less automation code in general, with what's left being more modular and composable 
    1. Decoupling and sharing automation, without locking it away inside Jenkinsfiles, Tiltfiles, Github Actions

Another use-case is **actually executable *tutorials / prototypes / PoCs***, somewhat in the spirit of literate programming.  Although some infrastructure-as-code ships with a tidy example repository.. lots of documentation refers to a long list of instructions you're supposed to copy/paste into a terminal, and expects you to bring your own cluster.

This reference aims to collect [**simple, self-contained demos for complex systems,**]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos) basically striving for bootstrapping won't pester you to install things first or expect you to bring your own cluster, yet can be extended easily to use remote clusters.

### How does it do it?
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

At a high level, the **k8s-tools suite** has 2 main components that can be used individually or together.  Those components are *a collection of tool-container definitions*, and an *automation framework for extending and interacting with the containers*.  

**[`k8s-tools.yml`]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/features)**

:   Aggregates 30+ individual utilities for working with kubernetes in one place, hosted inside a single docker-compose file.  Official sources are used where possible and containers defined here aren't built from scratch.  Low-level tools (*like `kubectl`, `helm`, etc*) mostly come from [alpine/k8s](https://hub.docker.com/r/alpine/k8s) but [many other tools]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/toolbox) (*like `argo`, `helm`, `knative`, `cdk`, `k9s`, `k3d`, `ansible`, etc*) are also included.  Tools containers are versioned independently, using defaults but allowing overrides, and are pulled only if/when they are used.

**[`k8s.mk`]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/k8s.mk)**

:   A library/utility that builds on k8s-tools.yml, providing powerful ways to run automation **inside** the tool-containers and script orchestration **across** them.  As a stand-alone utility, `k8s.mk` can enable interactive workflows like inspection and debugging.  As a library, it's especially useful for prototyping, and you can very quickly build on it to express custom project automation that's surprisingly **portable, powerful, and flexible**.

### Getting Started 
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

If you're waiting to learn more about what the k8s-tools suite can **do**, start at the [main demo for cluster lifecycle management]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/cluster-lifecycle).  Jump directly to [the quickstart]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/) if you want to start experimenting, or the [introduction to automation]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/k8s.mk) if you want to read a bit first.

1. Generally modernizing & extending `make` for containers, colors, & concurrency

Amongst other things it can help to fix the problem of different project developers using different local versions of things like `helm`, `kubectl`, etc.

You can also think of this project as a reference implementation for a pattern that [bridges compose services and Makefile targets]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/compose.mk#makecompose-bridge), creating a "minimum viable automation framework" for things like [orchestrating tasks across tool containers]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/compose.mk/#container-dispatch).  It's expressive and flexible, yet also focused on minimizing both conceptual overhead and software dependencies.  It's incredibly useful for lots of things, and whether it is a tool, a library, or a framework depends on how you decide to use it.  


There's a lot of hate for `make` (especially for "creative" usage of it!), but you'll find that these are not the Makefile's of your ancestors.  Support for [container dispatch]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/compose.mk#container-dispatch) feels like a tiny, unobtrusive DSL on top of tech you already know, and you can run it anywhere you are.  Less time spent negotiating with bolted-on plugin-frameworks, hook systems, and build-bots, more time for the problems you care about.  And yes, *the build-bots themselves will be happy to run your automation,* and the output is easy to parse.  See the [this repo's github actions](https://robot-wranglers.github.io/k8s-tools/actions?query=branch%3Amain), which bootstrap and exercise a cluster as part of the [end to end tests]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos#demo-cluster-automation).

**Working with [compose.mk]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/compose.mk) and [k8s.mk]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/k8s.mk) makes `make` hit different.**  

Beyond addressing the issues above, these tools add new capabilities to `make` itself, including some support for [quickly building custom TUIs]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/compose.mk#embedded-tui) from dockerized components.

{{macros.img_link("tui-6.gif", mkdocs, "90%")}}

With or without the TUI, all output is carefully curated and logged to appropriate output streams, aiming to be readable and human-friendly on stderr, while still remaining machine-friendly for downstream processing on stdout.  Help not only *works,* it also goes beyond mere target-listing to actually include namespace and per-target documentation, rendered via a dockerized version of [charmbracelete/glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow).

*Meet `compose.mk`, tool / library /framework for makefile-based automation, scripting, and lightweight orchestration.**  Native support for docker, docker-compose, workflow primitives, TUI elements, and more.

Meet **`compose.mk`,** which describes core support for docker, docker-compose, and other extensions for `make`, and **`k8s.mk`,** which uses `compose.mk` to build automation APIs over the `k8s-tools.yml` containers.
Besides bundling some tooling in k8s-tools.yml, there are 2 other components that can help to build automation.

**The full triple of *k8s.mk*, *compose.mk*, and *k8s-tools.yml* is called the k8s-tools suite.** 
<strong>`compose.mk` extends `make` to add native support for docker, workflows, TUI elements, and more.</strong>
