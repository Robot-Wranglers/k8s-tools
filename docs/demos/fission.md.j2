## FaaS with Fission

{#This demo shows an example of a project-local kubernetes cluster that bootstraps [Argo Workflows](#), then exercises workflows by dispatching them, reading logs, etc.  It's managed via [`k8s.mk`]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/k8s.mk), which is orchestrating usage of several different tools like `k3d`, `kubectl`, `helm`, and `fission`.

There are no host dependencies at all except for `make` and `docker`, and the entire thing runs locally or [inside of github actions]({{github.actions_url}}/fission.yml).

Since `k8s.mk` is built on top of [compose.mk]({{jinja.vars.composemk_docs_url}}), you'll want some of that background to completely understand the [demo code](#source-code), but for the most part it should be pretty easy to read and adapt.

The rest of this page is structured as follows.  [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) is up first, then [a (big) screenshot of end to end execution](#basic-usage).  After that we walk through some [other more interactive workflows](#interactive-workflows), and finally, the [inlined demo source code](#source-code).  

{#The source is also available from the repository, see {{macros.repo_link('demos/cluster-lifecycle.mk', github)}}.#}

### Basic Usage
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

Running the demo is simple: 

```bash {.cli_example}
# Default entrypoint runs cluster clean, 
# create, deploy, test but no cluster tear down
$ ./demos/fission.mk
```
{{macros.img_link(
    "fission.png", mkdocs, 
    "44%",class='cli_output')}}

### Interactive Workflows
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

Besides the main entrypoint, you can do things piecewise during development:

```bash {.cli_example}

# Use explicit stages for retrying piecewise 
$ ./demos/fission.mk clean create deploy test

# Drop into debugging shell for `fission` container
$ ./demos/fission.mk shell

# Finally, teardown the cluster
$ ./demos/fission.mk clean
```
