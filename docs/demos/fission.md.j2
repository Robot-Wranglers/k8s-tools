## FaaS with Fission
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

This demo shows an example of a project-local kubernetes cluster that bootstraps [Argo Workflows](#), then exercises workflows by dispatching them, reading logs, etc.  It's managed via [`k8s.mk`]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/k8s.mk), which is orchestrating usage of several different tools like `k3d`, `kubectl`, `helm`, and `fission`.

There are no host dependencies at all except for `make` and `docker`, and the entire thing runs locally or [inside of github actions]({{github.actions_url}}/fission.yml).

Since `k8s.mk` is built on top of [compose.mk]({{jinja.vars.composemk_docs_url}}), you'll want some of that background to completely understand the [demo code](#source-code), but for the most part it should be pretty easy to read and adapt.

---------------

The rest of this page is structured as follows.  [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) is up first, then [a (big) screenshot of end to end execution](#end-to-end-output).  After that we walk through some [other more interactive workflows](#interactive-workflows), and cap it off with the [inlined demo source code](#source-code).  The source is also available from the repository, see {{macros.repo_link('demos/cluster-lifecycle.mk', github)}}.

### Basic Usage
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

Running the demo is simple: 

```bash 

# Default entrypoint runs clean, create, deploy, test, but does not tear down the cluster.  
$ ./demos/fission.mk

# End-to-end, again without teardown 
$ ./demos/fission.mk clean create deploy test

# Finally, teardown the cluster
$ ./demos/fission.mk teardown
```
